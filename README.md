<p>
  First Receiving the ticket and identifying the severity and proper SLA
</p>
<br />



<p>
If the ticket is something I can solve, then I will take the ticket if I realise that I cannot solve the ticket I will reassign to someone who can after asking questions about the problem 
</p>
<br />



<p>
Assumming I can resolve the ticket I will work it to completion in adherance to the SLA of the ticket, communicating with the customer, and updating the notes of the ticket as we go along until eventual resolution of the ticket
